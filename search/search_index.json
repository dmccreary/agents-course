This design allows the model to leverage many expert subnetworks while keeping the inference budget similar to a ~37B dense model. The context window is extended to 128,000 tokens, supporting very long inputs and outputs (comparable to GPT-4's 128K context support) (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat) (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). The DeepSeek-R1 family includes the full MoE model (671B) and several distilled dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) that capture R1's reasoning patterns in smaller architectures (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). The distilled models are based on popular backbones like Qwen (Alibaba) and Llama and use the same tokenizer modifications as their bases for compatibility (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face).</p> <p>Training Methodology: The DeepSeek R1 training pipeline is novel in that it heavily uses reinforcement learning (RL) to instill reasoning skills. The initial \"DeepSeek-R1-Zero\" model was obtained by applying large-scale RL directly on a pre-trained base (DeepSeek-V3-Base) without any supervised fine-tuning (SFT) seed (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). This demonstrated that complex reasoning behaviors (like chain-of-thought, self-reflection, and self-verification) can emerge solely from RL rewards, a first in open research (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). However, R1-Zero suffered from issues like repetitive outputs and mixed-language responses (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). To address this, the final DeepSeek R1 model incorporated a more balanced training pipeline with two SFT stages and two RL stages (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). In practice, a small \"cold-start\" SFT on curated data was used to prime the base model (improving coherence and following instructions), then an RL phase encouraged the model to discover better reasoning strategies (e.g. using longer chain-of-thought for complex problems). This was followed by another SFT (to integrate the high-quality RL-generated solutions and improve general readability), and a final RL fine-tuning focused on aligning with human preferences and instructions (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). The RL training signal uses both learned reward models and rule-based verifiers -- for example, math answers are checked by an internal solver and code solutions by execution, similar to techniques used by OpenAI and Alibaba's Qwen team (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). Notably, DeepSeek R1's RL-first approach proved that even without an initial human-supervised phase, an LLM can learn to reason through trial-and-error reinforcement -- a key architectural innovation of this model (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face).</p> <p>Key Optimizations: Several optimizations in DeepSeek R1's architecture and training improved its efficiency and performance. In the underlying DeepSeek-V3 base (the foundation for R1), the team introduced an auxiliary-loss-free load balancing strategy for the MoE layers, ensuring that the many experts are utilized effectively without needing extra loss terms (GitHub - deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3). This addresses a common challenge in MoE models where some experts can become under-trained; DeepSeek's solution keeps expert usage balanced purely through careful gating architecture. The model also uses multi-token prediction objectives during pre-training (predicting multiple tokens per step) to boost training efficiency and downstream performance (GitHub - deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3). Standard enhancements like RoPE positional encodings for long context, SwiGLU activation, and RMSNorm are employed similar to other modern LLMs (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). Compared to dense models of similar scale, DeepSeek R1's MoE approach trades higher memory footprint for faster inference per token -- e.g. it has ~671B total weights (requiring ~1.5 TB VRAM to load fully), but only a fraction (~37B) are activated for each input, meaning inference compute is closer to a 37B model's cost (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). In practice, running the full DeepSeek-R1 requires a multi-GPU setup (e.g. 16\u00d7A100 GPUs) (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat), but the distilled R1 models provide much more accessible alternatives. For instance, the 32B distilled model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) can achieve comparable results with just ~24GB GPU memory needed (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat), using a dense architecture distilled from R1's knowledge. This strategy of training one very large \"teacher\" model and then compressing its knowledge into smaller models is a key optimization that DeepSeek uses to make deployment practical. All DeepSeek R1 models are released under a permissive MIT license, allowing commercial use and further modification (deepseek-r1), which contrasts with the more restrictive licenses of some contemporary open models. In summary, DeepSeek R1's design innovates by combining extreme scale (hundreds of billions of parameters), advanced MoE engineering, and an RL-driven training regime focused on reasoning -- setting it apart from conventional LLM training pipelines (which usually rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning and human feedback alignment before any RL).</p> <p>Parameters and Efficiency vs. Other LLMs: In terms of size, DeepSeek R1 (671B) is one of the largest language models ever publicized. It far exceeds the dense parameter count of models like GPT-4 (estimated on the order of ~170B to 1T, though exact numbers are unpublished) and Meta's Llama 3 (which introduced a 405B dense variant as its largest model) (What Is Meta's Llama 3.1 405B? How It Works, Use Cases &amp; More) (GitHub - deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3). Even Google's PaLM 2 and Gemini prototypes are smaller in parameter count than R1's total. However, thanks to its MoE architecture, R1's effective inference footprint (37B) is lower than GPT-4's if GPT-4 is purely dense -- making R1 surprisingly efficient for its scale. For example, GPT-4's 32k-context version is known to be very resource-intensive, whereas DeepSeek R1 can handle 128k context with its MoE sharding of work across experts (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat) (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). Against Llama 3, the largest Llama 3.1 (405B dense) achieves strong performance but still slightly trails DeepSeek R1 on challenging benchmarks (e.g. MMLU) (GitHub - deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3), likely because R1's RL-enhanced reasoning gives it an edge beyond what scaling alone provided. Smaller open models like Mistral (7B) and Falcon (40B) are dramatically smaller than R1 and emphasize efficiency and speed on limited hardware, but they cannot match DeepSeek R1's state-of-the-art results in complex tasks due to the vast gap in training scale and techniques. For instance, Falcon-40B (one of the best pre-R1 open models) scored around 54% on MMLU (MMLU: Better Benchmarking for LLM Language Understanding), whereas R1 approaches ~91% on the same benchmark (see next section). In summary, DeepSeek R1 pushes the limits of model size and training innovation, going beyond the architectures of GPT-4 and others by using MoE at scale and RL-driven training. Its design balances the frontier of maximum capability with strategies (like distillation and MoE gating) to make such capability usable in practice.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/deepseek-r1/#benchmarks-and-performance","title":"Benchmarks and Performance","text":"<p>DeepSeek R1 has been evaluated on a wide range of standard NLP and reasoning benchmarks, where it achieves cutting-edge performance comparable to or surpassing other leading LLMs of 2024-2025. Below is a summary of how R1 stacks up on key tasks:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Knowledge and Reasoning (MMLU): On the Massive Multitask Language Understanding benchmark (MMLU, which tests knowledge across 57 subjects), DeepSeek R1 scores around 90.8% (accuracy) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). This is essentially at GPT-4 level -- for comparison, an OpenAI model (\"o1-1217\", presumably GPT-4 or similar) scored 91.8% on the same test (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). R1's score also exceeds Anthropic's Claude 3.5 (which was ~88--90% (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face)) and vastly outperforms open-source predecessors like Llama 2 (which was ~68% on MMLU) and Falcon-40B (~54% (MMLU: Better Benchmarking for LLM Language Understanding)). In a variant \"MMLU-Redux\" evaluation, R1 reached 92.9%, the highest among the compared models (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). These results demonstrate that R1 has acquired a broad range of world knowledge and can reason across domains nearly as well as the best proprietary models.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mathematical Reasoning (GSM8K, MATH, AIME): DeepSeek R1 particularly shines at math and quantitative reasoning tasks, likely due to its RL-based training that emphasized step-by-step solution verification. On GSM8K (Grade School Math problems), R1 achieves high accuracy -- sources indicate 85%+ range (DeepSeek R1 vs Qwen 2.5 Max: A Detailed Comparison of Features and Performance), which is on par with or slightly above GPT-4's performance on this dataset. For more advanced math, R1 reached 79.8% pass@1 on the AIME 2024 math competition problems (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face), essentially tying OpenAI's model (which scored 79.2%). On the challenging MATH dataset (MATH-500) of high school math problems, R1's chain-of-thought solving ability yields an impressive 97.3% pass@1 (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face) -- outperforming OpenAI's reference (96.4%). These numbers are remarkable: they suggest DeepSeek R1 can correctly solve nearly all math questions in that benchmark when allowed to generate and evaluate multiple solution attempts. In summary, R1 has state-of-the-art math reasoning skills, leveraging its self-reflection and verifier-enhanced training to check its work. This is a significant improvement over models like GPT-3.5 or Llama, which struggled with complex multi-step math. Even smaller distilled versions of R1 do well -- e.g. the 32B distilled model achieves over 72% on GSM8K and ~94% on MATH, rivaling much larger dense models (DeepSeek R1 vs Qwen 2.5 Max: A Detailed Comparison of Features and Performance) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face).</p> </li> <li> <p>Coding and Code Reasoning: DeepSeek R1 is highly proficient at coding tasks. On HumanEval (a benchmark of Python coding problems), R1 achieves about 71% pass@1 (solving rate) (DeepSeek R1 vs Qwen 2.5 Max: A Detailed Comparison of Features and Performance), slightly edging out Alibaba's Qwen-2.5 Max (69.3%) and comparable to GPT-4's level on this test. This indicates that given a programming prompt, R1 can write correct solutions the majority of the time without needing multiple attempts. Moreover, R1 was tested on more difficult coding benchmarks that involve reasoning and multi-step planning. For instance, on LiveCodeBench (which requires generating code with intermediate reasoning steps), R1 attained 65.9% pass@1 (with chain-of-thought), which is higher than OpenAI's smaller model (o1-mini 53.8%) and even slightly above OpenAI's full model (~63.4%) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). Additionally, R1 was evaluated on Codeforces programming challenges, where it achieved a competitive Elo rating around 2030, very close to OpenAI's result (~2061) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). These results suggest R1 not only writes correct code, but can handle complex programming puzzles with reasoning -- a testament to the effectiveness of its RL training on coding tasks (possibly using code execution feedback as a reward). In practical terms, DeepSeek R1's coding ability is among the best in class, making it useful for code generation, debugging, and assisting in software tasks at a level comparable to top closed models. Even the distilled R1-32B model shows strong coding performance (~57% on LiveCodeBench, Codeforces ~1690 rating) outperforming other open models of similar size (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face).</p> </li> <li> <p>General NLP and Text Generation: Beyond specialized tasks, R1 was evaluated on general instruction-following and reasoning benchmarks. In AlpacaEval 2.0, a benchmark that compares models on helpfulness and clarity of responses to instructions, DeepSeek R1 had an 87.6% win rate in pairwise comparisons (beating a strong reference in the vast majority of test prompts) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). This is notably higher than Claude 3.5 (~52%) or GPT-4 (~51%) in that evaluation, indicating R1 produces very high-quality, helpful responses in a chat/instruction setting (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). Similarly, on Big Bench Hard (BBH) -- a collection of challenging reasoning tasks -- R1 scored about 80.2%, slightly above Qwen-2.5 Max's 78.5% (DeepSeek R1 vs Qwen 2.5 Max: A Detailed Comparison of Features and Performance). These scores underline R1's strength in complex reasoning and following instructions: thanks to its reinforcement learning fine-tuning, it can perform lengthy chain-of-thought reasoning and self-check its answers, leading to very thorough and correct responses on difficult queries. However, some trade-offs were observed: in a Prompt Strictness test (following instructions to the letter), R1 scored a bit lower (83.3) than Claude 3.5 (86.5) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face), suggesting that R1's focus on deep reasoning sometimes comes at the cost of strictly obeying the prompt format or brevity. Overall, for text generation tasks requiring reasoning, depth, and accuracy, R1 is among the top performers, whereas for simple prompt adherence or safe-chat behavior, models like Claude (with heavy alignment training) might have an edge.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multilingual Understanding: DeepSeek R1 was trained on a large multilingual corpus (notably both English and Chinese data), and it exhibits excellent multilingual capabilities. On C-Eval, a comprehensive Chinese evaluation benchmark, DeepSeek R1 achieved 91.8% (exact match) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face), dramatically surpassing GPT-4's performance (~76.0% on the same test) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). This indicates R1 has a superior grasp of Chinese academic and common knowledge tasks, likely due to targeted training data and perhaps specific rewards in RL for Chinese reasoning. On a Chinese WSC (winograd style coreference) test, R1 also tops the charts at 92.8% (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). In a Chinese simple QA benchmark, R1 is slightly ahead of GPT-4 (63.7% vs 58.7% accuracy) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). These results demonstrate that R1 is not just an English-centric model but a bilingual powerhouse, especially strong in Chinese -- likely on par with or better than native Chinese models. For other languages, R1's multilingual training (and possibly larger context) help it perform robustly, though detailed scores weren't listed in the source, we can infer from related benchmarks (XGLUE, XTREME) that it performs competitively but might be edged out by models like Qwen 2.5 Max in some multilingual categories (DeepSeek R1 vs Qwen 2.5 Max: A Detailed Comparison of Features and Performance) (since Qwen was specifically optimized for broad multilingual support). Still, the availability of R1's model for multiple languages has been a boon for non-English NLP. Its performance in multilingual QA and cross-lingual tasks is state-of-the-art among open models, reducing the gap with specialized models built for those languages.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In summary, DeepSeek R1's benchmark performance is on par with the very best LLMs (GPT-4 class) in many areas. It excels at complex reasoning, coding, and math -- often matching or slightly surpassing GPT-4 and Claude on those tasks (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). It also holds its own in knowledge and general understanding tasks (MMLU ~90+%). There are a few areas where OpenAI's or others maintain a lead, such as certain open-ended knowledge queries (for example, OpenAI's model scored higher on a broad GPQA benchmark: 75.7 vs R1's 71.5 (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face)) -- suggesting GPT-4 might have an edge in extensive world knowledge or factual recall. But the gaps are small. Importantly, R1's distilled smaller models also achieve remarkable performance for their size. The 32B R1-Distill, for instance, outperforms OpenAI's smaller \"o1-mini\" model across many benchmarks (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face), setting new state-of-art results among models in the 30B-70B range. This means R1's impact isn't limited to those with giant compute clusters -- its knowledge has effectively trickled down to models one can run on a single GPU, without losing too much accuracy. The upshot is that DeepSeek R1 established itself as one of the top-performing LLMs across the board, validating the team's emphasis on reasoning-centric training through strong benchmark results in reasoning, coding, text generation quality, and multilingual understanding.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/deepseek-r1/#comparison-with-other-llms","title":"Comparison with Other LLMs","text":"<p>DeepSeek R1 arrives in a landscape alongside both proprietary giants (like OpenAI's GPT-4 series and Anthropic's Claude) and open-source models (like Meta's Llama 3 and newcomers such as Mistral and Falcon). Below we highlight how DeepSeek R1 differs from and compares to these models in terms of capabilities, efficiency, and deployment:</p> <ul> <li> <p>GPT-4 (OpenAI \"o\" series): GPT-4 is the most prominent closed-source model and R1's performance peer. In head-to-head comparisons, DeepSeek R1 is roughly on par with GPT-4 on many academic and coding benchmarks -- for example, their MMLU scores differ by only ~1% (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face), and they trade blows on coding tasks (GPT-4 slightly behind on some, slightly ahead on others) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). Architecturally, GPT-4 is believed to be a dense transformer (possibly with some mixture-of-expert components internally, but not confirmed) with an estimated hundreds of billions of parameters. DeepSeek R1, by contrast, is explicitly a Mixture-of-Experts model with 671B parameters total (and 37B active) (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). This gives R1 an advantage in specialization (many experts can handle different aspects of a problem) but makes it heavy to deploy in full. GPT-4's training relied on a large supervised fine-tuning and human-feedback loop, making it very aligned and reliable in following instructions and staying within guardrails. R1's training put more emphasis on autonomous reasoning via RL, which yielded superior problem-solving but at times slightly less compliance (as seen in prompt strictness tests) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). In practical use, GPT-4 might produce more concise or safe answers by default, whereas R1 might produce more detailed, step-by-step explanations (since it was rewarded for showing its reasoning). Capabilities: Both models handle a wide spectrum of tasks (coding, writing, reasoning, etc.). GPT-4 remains a bit better in open-domain knowledge QA (likely due to broader training data or retrieval strategies in deployment) (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face), whereas R1 has a slight edge in systematic reasoning (e.g. long math proofs, complex code with self-checking). GPT-4 is multi-modal (can accept images) in some versions; DeepSeek R1 is text-only (no image input capability reported in R1). Efficiency and Deployment: GPT-4 is accessible only via API (cloud) and not runnable locally, with OpenAI tightly controlling its model. DeepSeek R1 is fully open-source -- anyone can download the weights (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face) -- but running the full 671B model requires significant hardware (multi-GPU server). However, R1's distilled models (e.g. 32B, 70B) can be run on a single high-end GPU or modest GPU cluster, giving practitioners a local alternative that approximates GPT-4-level performance. In terms of context length, both are in the top tier: GPT-4 supports up to 128k tokens (with the 2024 updates), and R1 similarly supports 128k context out of the box (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). This makes them both suitable for lengthy documents or transcripts, unlike many smaller models. In sum, DeepSeek R1 has essentially brought GPT-4-like capabilities to the open source world, with slight differences in style and accessibility: GPT-4 is still the leader in fine alignment and perhaps breadth of training data, while R1 demonstrates the power of an RL-trained, openly available model that organizations can host themselves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Claude (Anthropic): Claude 2 and 3 (e.g. Claude 3.5 \"Sonnet\") are Anthropic's large models focusing on safety and large context. Claude 3.5 was one of the first to offer 100k token context windows and is known for being very conversationally aligned (trying to be helpful, harmless, honest). In evaluations, Claude 3.5 Sonnet reaches about 90.5% on MMLU, roughly equal to R1 and GPT-4. However, in coding and some reasoning tasks, Claude tends to lag slightly behind both GPT-4 and R1. For example, Claude 3.5 scored ~52% win-rate on AlpacaEval vs R1's 87% (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face), indicating that on complex instruction-following, R1 can provide more robust answers. Claude's strength is its harmlessness and compliance -- it's less likely to produce problematic content and often follows user instructions very literally. R1, while aligned via RLHF in its final stage, may not have undergone as intensive a safety training as Claude, so it might be more prone to generating unfiltered content if prompted maliciously (though no specific issues have been reported publicly). Efficiency: Claude is closed-source and accessible through API (Anthropic's), with no known parameter count (estimated similar scale to GPT-4). R1's open availability is a contrast -- anyone worrying about data privacy or needing offline use can opt for R1's models instead of Claude. Context: Both offer huge context (Claude 100k vs R1 128k), making them suitable for long documents and conversations. Use cases: If an enterprise's priority is a pre-aligned, safety-first model with massive context (and doesn't mind cloud usage), Claude is attractive. If the priority is maximal reasoning ability, code proficiency, and self-hosting, DeepSeek R1 is a compelling alternative, delivering stronger problem-solving performance in many cases. It's worth noting that R1's RL-based reasoning is somewhat in line with Anthropic's philosophy of constitutional AI (models improving via feedback); both signify a move towards models that can reflect on their answers. But R1 took a more direct approach by training with explicit problem-solving rewards, whereas Claude was trained on a large mix of dialogue with a safety-focused objective.</p> </li> <li> <p>Llama 3 (Meta): Meta's Llama series (Llama 2 was 2023, Llama 3 in 2024) represents the cutting edge of open foundational models. Llama 3 introduced models at 8B, 70B, and a gargantuan 405B \"Llama 3.1\" model (What Is Meta's Llama 3.1 405B? How It Works, Use Cases &amp; More). The 405B Llama is a dense model that Meta made available to researchers and on platforms like Azure, touting it as the largest open model at the time. Despite its size and quality (it outperforms Llama 2 by a large margin and is competitive with many proprietary models (What Is Meta's Llama 3.1 405B? How It Works, Use Cases &amp; More)), Llama 3.1--405B slightly underperforms DeepSeek R1 on reasoning benchmarks -- for instance, Llama3.1 achieved ~88.6% on MMLU (GitHub - deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3), whereas R1 reached ~90.8%. This suggests that beyond a certain scale, training methodology becomes crucial: R1's specialized reinforcement learning approach likely extracted more reasoning ability than Meta's standard next-token prediction training plus instruction tuning. On coding, Llama 70B or 405B are strong (Llama 70B chat was around ~67% HumanEval), but R1 still has the edge (71%+ HumanEval) (DeepSeek R1 vs Qwen 2.5 Max: A Detailed Comparison of Features and Performance). Where Llama 3 excels is being a versatile base -- many fine-tuned variants exist for various tasks, and it is fully open (though with a Meta-specific license). DeepSeek R1 actually leverages Llama 3 in its distilled models -- for example, \"DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B\" is R1's knowledge distilled into a Llama 3.3 70B instruct model (deepseek-r1) (deepseek-r1). This cross-pollination shows that R1 complements Llama: one can use R1 as an oracle teacher to improve Llama-family models. Efficiency: Llama 3's 70B and smaller models can run on a single GPU (with 70B needing ~2\u00d748GB GPUs or so), making them easier to deploy than R1's full model. The 405B Llama3 obviously is large (likely requiring 8+ GPUs), but still it's a dense model -- some simpler infrastructure than MoE. R1's MoE might be trickier to serve (needing a custom MoE runtime or partitioning across experts). Deployment: Both R1 and Llama 3 are open; however, Meta's license for Llama might restrict commercial use (as was the case with Llama 2's license for certain users). DeepSeek R1 is MIT licensed (very permissive) (deepseek-r1), which encourages broader adoption, even in commercial products, without legal worry. Another difference is training data focus: Llama was trained on a balanced multilingual corpus but not especially targeting any single domain. DeepSeek R1's base (DeepSeek-V3) was trained on a massive 14.8T token corpus including a lot of English/Chinese and technical data (GitHub - deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3), and then R1 was further tuned on reasoning heavy data. Thus R1 might have more baked-in \"problem-solving knowledge\" (e.g. math proofs, code debugging logs, etc.) than a vanilla Llama. For a developer deciding between them: if one wants a solid general-purpose model to fine-tune, Llama 70B is great; if one wants the best reasoning out-of-the-box and possibly to study novel training techniques, DeepSeek R1 is the exemplar.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mistral (Open-Source Efficient LLMs): Mistral 7B (2023) and any subsequent models from Mistral AI highlight efficiency: the 7B model was trained on a high-quality dataset and tuned to outperform larger models like Llama2-13B in many tasks, despite its small size. However, there is a clear gap between what can be achieved at single-digit billions of parameters and what R1 (with hundreds of billions + specialized training) achieves. For example, Mistral 7B's MMLU score is around mid-60s% (Mistral 7B vs DeepSeek R1 Performance: Which LLM is the Better Choice?), whereas R1 is ~90%. On coding, Mistral 7B might score ~30-40% on HumanEval, versus R1's 71%. These differences are huge -- indicating that while techniques like data quality, longer training, and smart initialization can boost a small model, they cannot fully compensate for scale and advanced training on the hardest tasks. That said, Mistral and similar models have an ultra-low footprint: a 7B model can run on a consumer laptop or even a phone in some cases. DeepSeek R1's distilled 7B (there is an R1-distill Qwen-7B model) actually leverages R1's strengths to also outperform standard 7B models (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). In fact, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B (Qwen base) reportedly achieves ~49% on HumanEval and ~83% on GSM8K (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face), which is much higher than a naive 7B model could do -- showing the value of R1's knowledge transfer. So, comparing R1 to Mistral: R1 is a research-grade, maximum performance model, whereas Mistral 7B (and hypothetical 13B or 20B follow-ups) are deployment-grade, compact models. One might use R1 to generate data or insights to then fine-tune a Mistral model, for instance. Another difference: R1 uses 128k context; most small models have 4k to 8k context (Mistral 7B extended to 8k with RoPE scaling). So R1 also wins in context length by a large margin over typical small models. In sum, R1 isn't directly \"competing\" with a 7B model -- they occupy different ends of the spectrum -- but R1 has redefined the upper bound of open model capability, whereas Mistral et al. define how far one can go with minimal parameter budgets. It's worth noting that R1's advent may inspire more efficient techniques to approximate its performance: e.g., Alibaba's QwQ-32B showed that clever multi-stage RL on a 32B model could reach R1-like reasoning quality (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat) (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). So smaller, efficient LLMs are quickly learning from R1's example to narrow the gap.</p> </li> <li> <p>Falcon and Other Open Models: Falcon-40B (from TII UAE) was a leading open model prior to Llama 2, with good performance on English tasks but relatively weaker alignment and limited context (2048 tokens). DeepSeek R1 clearly outperforms Falcon-40B by a wide margin on virtually every benchmark (knowledge, reasoning, etc.), as indicated by Falcon's ~63% average on some evaluations vs R1's ~90% in the same (MMLU: Better Benchmarking for LLM Language Understanding). R1's release (and that of Llama 2/3) essentially eclipsed Falcon, though Falcon demonstrated the viability of large open models (and had an Apache license). Other models like PaLM 2 (Google) and Gemini (Google DeepMind) are closed-source but were expected to be strong; the VentureBeat article notes that by late 2024, OpenAI's \"o3\" series and Google's Gemini were also focusing on reasoning and extended context, partly influenced by the success of models like DeepSeek R1 (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). We see that R1 pushed the envelope, causing even the big players to iterate (e.g., OpenAI's hypothetical \"o3\" might be an even more reasoning-focused successor to GPT-4). In deployment terms, R1 being open means organizations that prefer self-hosting had, for the first time, an alternative to relying on API access to GPT-4/Claude for top-tier performance. This is a significant strategic difference from proprietary models -- R1 can be deployed on Azure AI Foundry, on local servers, or via community projects like Hugging Face and Ollama, giving users more control (DeepSeek R1 is now available on Azure AI Foundry and GitHub | Microsoft Azure Blog). Models like GPT-4/Claude require trusting a third-party service. On the flip side, proprietary models often integrate up-to-date knowledge (live browsing or tools) in their offerings, something R1 by itself doesn't do (though one can combine R1 with retrieval systems in a RAG pipeline to mitigate its knowledge cutoff).</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"concepts/deepseek-r1/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>In summary, DeepSeek R1 stands out for its unprecedented combination of openness and high performance. Against closed models (GPT-4, Claude), it competes neck-and-neck in ability while offering the transparency and modifiability of open source. Against other open models (Llama 3, Falcon, Mistral), R1 defines the high end of capability, introducing training innovations that others are now adopting or distilling. Each model has its niche: GPT-4 remains the general-purpose gold standard with strong factuality and multi-modality, Claude is the aligned long-context specialist, Llama is the adaptable open base model, and DeepSeek R1 is the reasoning and problem-solving expert that bridges the gap between research and open deployment. The existence of R1 has effectively raised the bar for all LLMs, ensuring that new models (whether open or closed) must contend with a state-of-the-art performer that is freely available for anyone to use or build upon.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/deepseek-r1/#code-example-using-deepseek-r1-with-ollama","title":"Code Example (Using DeepSeek R1 with Ollama)","text":"<p>One convenient way to run DeepSeek R1 models locally is via Ollama, a tool for serving and using LLMs on local GPUs. The DeepSeek R1 family is available in Ollama's model library, including the distilled versions that are feasible to run on a single GPU. Below is a code snippet demonstrating how to download and run the DeepSeek R1 32B distilled model (which offers excellent performance) using Ollama on a local machine:</p> <pre><code># Install Ollama (if not already installed) and ensure you have a GPU with sufficient VRAM (e.g. 24GB for the 32B model).\n\n# Pull the DeepSeek-R1 32B model from Ollama's library:\nollama pull deepseek-r1:32b\n\n# Once the model is downloaded, you can run queries against it.\n# For example, ask a question or prompt:\nollama run deepseek-r1:32b --prompt \"Explain the architecture of DeepSeek R1 in a few sentences.\"\n</code></pre> <p>The above commands will load the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model and execute the given prompt on your local GPU. You should see the model's generated answer in the console. The <code>ollama pull</code> step is only needed the first time to download the weights; afterward, <code>ollama run deepseek-r1:32b \"&lt;your prompt&gt;\"</code> is sufficient. You can replace <code>32b</code> with other available model sizes (such as <code>70b</code> for the 70B Llama-derived model, or <code>7b</code> for a smaller model) depending on your hardware capacity (deepseek-r1) (deepseek-r1). For instance, <code>ollama run deepseek-r1:70b</code> would run the 70B distilled model (which may require 2\u00d7GPU for smooth operation), and <code>ollama run deepseek-r1:7b</code> would run a much smaller 7B model. All DeepSeek R1 models in Ollama are under the MIT license, so they can be used commercially. This local deployment option illustrates the practicality of R1's open-source approach -- even though the flagship 671B model is huge, its distilled offspring allow developers to experiment with R1's capabilities on everyday hardware.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/deepseek-r1/#strategic-consequences","title":"Strategic Consequences","text":"<p>The release of DeepSeek R1 has had significant strategic implications for the AI development landscape, especially in the open-source community and global AI competition:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Democratizing High-End AI: Perhaps the most immediate impact of DeepSeek R1 is that it bridged the performance gap between open-source and closed-source models. Prior to R1, the best open models (like Llama 2 or Falcon) were notably behind models like GPT-4 in capability. R1's emergence as an open model comparable to GPT-4 (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face) proved that top-tier AI is not exclusive to tech giants. This has empowered researchers, startups, and even hobbyists worldwide -- they now have access to a GPT-4-class model that can be studied and integrated without needing permission or hefty API fees. Microsoft's inclusion of DeepSeek R1 in Azure AI Foundry (DeepSeek R1 is now available on Azure AI Foundry and GitHub | Microsoft Azure Blog) underscores this democratization: a major cloud provider saw value in offering R1 alongside proprietary models, giving enterprise customers more choice. The strategic shift here is that open models are now part of the \"frontier models\" conversation, not just supporting players. We see organizations leveraging R1 to build advanced applications entirely on open infrastructure, which pressures closed model providers to justify their cost and policies. In essence, DeepSeek R1 fueled a greater openness in AI, forcing a reevaluation of the balance between proprietary advantage and community collaboration.</p> </li> <li> <p>Influence on Research Directions: DeepSeek R1's successful use of reinforcement learning for reasoning has spurred new research into LLM training techniques. The fact that R1-Zero showed emergent reasoning purely from RL rewards (no initial human examples) was a groundbreaking result (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). This has encouraged other AI labs to experiment with reinforcement learning, self-play, and other beyond-supervised methods to push reasoning capabilities. For example, OpenAI's rumored \"o3\" series and projects like Anthropic's next Claude are likely incorporating lessons from R1, focusing on inference-time reasoning loops, self-reflection, and multi-stage training (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). We also see academic interest in the idea of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) as a category, which R1 exemplifies -- models that explicitly perform internal reasoning steps to improve answer quality (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). Additionally, R1's distillation of reasoning into smaller models validated a path to efficiency: rather than training a small model to do reasoning from scratch, use a big RL-tuned teacher to generate high-quality reasoning traces and fine-tune the small model on that. This approach achieved better results for the 32B model than training it with RL directly (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). As a consequence, we're seeing a strategic shift in how new models are developed -- many teams are now adopting a two-stage approach (train a very large model with new techniques, then compress it). The open release of R1 (and its data) has given researchers a wealth of material to study, leading to a flurry of papers analyzing its chain-of-thought outputs, its reward model design, and even its failures, which ultimately advances the field's understanding of LLM cognition.</p> </li> <li> <p>Acceleration of Open-Source AI: R1's impact on the open-source AI movement cannot be overstated. It demonstrated that an relatively small lab (DeepSeek-AI, a spin-off from a finance firm (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat)) could not only build a model competitive with those from tech giants, but also open-source it under a permissive license. This has encouraged other companies and organizations to open-source their strong models as well. Within months of R1's release, we saw Alibaba announce Qwen 2.5 Max (72B) and QwQ-32B, open-sourced under Apache 2.0, claiming performance on par with R1 (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). Likewise, Meta pushed forward with Llama 3.1 405B and made it available to the public (What Is Meta's Llama 3.1 405B? How It Works, Use Cases &amp; More). Each of these moves is a strategic response to R1 -- essentially a realization that open models can drive rapid adoption. DeepSeek R1 quickly became one of the most visited AI model websites globally (second only to OpenAI's), indicating enormous interest and community uptake (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). This user base in turn contributes back improvements, extensions (such as integrations into applications, or fine-tuned domain-specific versions), creating a positive feedback loop for the model's evolution. We also see governments and NGOs taking note: for instance, R1 being open means countries concerned about access to GPT-4 have an alternative they can control. Strategically, this could reduce reliance on a handful of AI providers and distribute AI capabilities more evenly worldwide.</p> </li> <li> <p>Competitive Pressure on Proprietary Models: Strategically, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic now face a more level playing field. While they still hold some advantages (compute resources, multi-modal capabilities, proprietary data), the margin of AI superiority they enjoyed shrank because of models like R1. This has likely spurred them to invest in next-generation technologies -- e.g., focusing on multimodality (images, video, tools) where open models haven't yet caught up, or massively increasing context length (as Google did with a 2 million token context experiment) (qwq-32b-launches-high-efficiency-performance-reinforcement | VentureBeat). It may also influence pricing and openness: OpenAI, for example, might eventually consider offering on-premise versions or weight licenses of their models to compete with the free availability of R1 (something that was previously unthinkable). We have already seen a \"model proliferation\" effect: many new startups releasing specialized LLMs (for reasoning, for dialogue, for coding) because R1 proved that with innovation, newcomers can beat established models in niches. Strategically, Big Tech can no longer assume their lead in LLMs will translate to usage monopoly -- the community can and will catch up. This dynamic could lead to faster progress overall, but also raises questions of safety: powerful models are now widely available, so ensuring responsible use becomes a distributed challenge. In response, initiatives for open model evaluation and alignment (some sponsored by governments) have ramped up, treating models like R1 as benchmarks for what open models can do.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ecosystem and Applications: DeepSeek R1 has enriched the AI ecosystem by being integrated into various platforms and pipelines. Its strong performance in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios has been noted -- one guide calls it a way to \"supercharge RAG projects with DeepSeek R1\", thanks to its precise reasoning over retrieved documents (Supercharge RAG Projects with DeepSeek R1 AI Reasoning Model). This is steering application developers to consider using R1 for tasks like enterprise Q&amp;A, analytics, and decision support, often in place of closed models. The strategic consequence is that organizations can build sophisticated AI features without dependency on a single vendor. We also see R1's influence in education and research: universities use R1 as a teaching tool for AI courses (since it's inspectable), and researchers build on top of R1 for things like agent frameworks (knowing that R1 can handle long-horizon reasoning). Open-source community projects, from chatbots to coding assistants, now frequently include DeepSeek R1 or its distilled variants as a backbone. This broad adoption is shaping AI development priorities -- for example, there is increased interest in scaling laws for reinforcement learning (thanks to R1's approach) and in safety for open models (making sure models like R1 are as rigorously tested as closed ones).</p> </li> </ul> <p>In conclusion, DeepSeek R1's launch and open-source release have acted as a catalyst in the AI world: accelerating innovation, encouraging openness, and driving competitive and collaborative responses in equal measure. It has proven that cutting-edge AI need not be locked behind corporate doors, and in doing so, it has shifted strategic priorities -- from how models are trained (more focus on reasoning and RL) to how they are shared (greater openness) to how they are deployed (embracing on-premise and hybrid solutions). The \"DeepSeek effect\" -- a small team achieving big AI breakthroughs and sharing them -- is inspiring a new wave of AI development globally, ensuring that the race for ever more intelligent systems benefits from the collective efforts of the whole research community, not just a few large players (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 - Hugging Face). The end result is a more vibrant, accessible, and fast-evolving AI landscape, with DeepSeek R1 having carved its name as one of the pivotal contributions to this shift.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/deepseek-r1/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>DeepSeek-AI (2025).

Hmm, where do I start? I've taken geometry before, but it's been a while, so some of these might have faded from my  memory. Let me think step by step. <p>First off, when I was learning geometry, one topic that always confused me was proofs. There were so many theorems and properties to remember, and constructing a logical argument seemed like a whole other language. I can't even recall exactly what an auxiliary line is, but I know it's used in proofs somehow.</p> <p>Then there are circles. I remember they have circumference, area, radius, diameter, and all those formulas, but when you start talking about angles subtended by chords or tangents, things got really tangled for me. It was hard to keep track of the different theorems related to circles, like the inscribed angle theorem or  something.</p> <p>Triangles are another big topic in geometry. There are so many types\u2014scalene, isosceles, equilateral\u2014and each has its own properties. Then there's Pythagoras' theorem for right-angled triangles, which I sometimes mixed  up with other formulas because they all looked similar. Also, triangle congruence and similarity were confusing at times; remembering SAS and ASA rules was a struggle.</p> <p>Coordinate geometry also tripped me up. It combines algebra and geometry, so you have to visualize shapes on the coordinate plane and use equations to find distances, slopes, and intersections. I remember struggling with finding the distance between two points using the distance formula and calculating midpoints or perpendicular lines.</p> <p>Transformations like translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations were another area where I had trouble. Understanding how figures change position or size on the coordinate plane was confusing without a clear visual. Also, similarity transformations confused me because they involved scaling, which adds another  layer of complexity.</p> <p>Trigonometry in geometry felt separate from what I had learned before. Learning sine, cosine, and tangent functions to find side lengths and angles in right triangles was initially tough. Then, when we moved on to  the unit circle, everything shifted, and it became even more abstract. I had trouble understanding how trigonometric ratios extended beyond right triangles.</p> <p>Three-dimensional geometry confused me a lot. Moving from 2D shapes to 3D solids like prisms, pyramids, cylinders, cones, and spheres introduced new concepts and formulas. Calculating surface area and volume required knowing which formula to apply when, and I often mixed them up or used the wrong dimensions in  calculations.</p> <p>Parallelograms had their own set of properties that needed to be memorized for proofs. Proving whether a quadrilateral was a parallelogram based on given information was tricky because there were multiple ways to  show it, like using opposite sides equal or parallel lines and angles.</p> <p>Probability in geometry was another point where I struggled. It wasn't just basic probability; integrating geometric principles made the problems more complex. Calculating probabilities based on areas or lengths required a good understanding of both geometry and probability concepts.</p> <p>Lastly, constructions with a compass and straightedge were a nightmare. It involved precise steps without any measurements, which felt restrictive. Forgetting a step in a construction could lead to an incorrect figure, and figuring out the right sequence without trial and error was frustrating.</p> <p>Wait, did I miss anything? Let me think... Maybe locus problems where you have to find points satisfying certain conditions. Or maybe transformations again; they were mentioned before but perhaps not explicitly listed as top 10. Hmm, since it's about difficulty, maybe those are already covered.</p> <p>I should also consider if the order makes sense. Proofs seem foundational but can be really challenging because they require logical reasoning. Then coordinate geometry and constructions build on previous knowledge with algebra and precise drawing skills. Trigonometry and circles add layers of complexity with their formulas and applications. Three-dimensional geometry might come last as it's more abstract.</p> <p>Yeah, I think that covers the main areas where students usually struggle in high school geometry.
