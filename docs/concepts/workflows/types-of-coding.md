# Types of Coding

## Procedural Code

Procedural code is a programming paradigm that focuses on defining a sequence of operations for a computer to execute. It emphasizes how a program should accomplish tasks through explicit step-by-step instructions, control flow structures, and state changes. Procedural code typically organizes functionality into procedures or functions that are called in a predetermined order.

Comparison with Declarative and Agentic Code
--------------------------------------------

| Aspect | Procedural Code | Declarative Code | Agentic Code |
| --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |
| **Focus** | How to perform tasks (step-by-step instructions) | What should be accomplished (desired outcome) | Goals to achieve (with autonomous execution) |
| --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |
| **Control Flow** | Explicitly defined by the programmer | Implicit, determined by the execution environment | Dynamic, determined by the agent based on goals and environment |
| **State Management** | Direct manipulation of program state | Minimized state changes, often immutable | Internal state that influences decision-making |
| **Abstraction Level** | Lower-level, focused on operations | Higher-level, focused on relationships | High-level, focused on objectives |
| **Examples** | Imperative languages like C, traditional Python scripts | SQL, HTML, CSS, functional programming | AI agents, automated planning systems |
| **Decision Making** | Predetermined by the programmer | Rules-based evaluation | Autonomous reasoning and adaptation |
| **Adaptability** | Requires explicit programming for different scenarios | Adapts within defined constraints | Can discover novel approaches to solve problems |

Procedural code explicitly states the sequence of steps to follow, while declarative code describes the desired result without specifying the exact implementation. Agentic code, the newest paradigm, introduces autonomy and goal-oriented behavior, allowing the system to determine appropriate actions based on its understanding of objectives and environmental conditions.
