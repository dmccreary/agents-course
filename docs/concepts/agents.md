# Software Agents

A software agent is an autonomous computational entity that performs tasks on behalf of users or other programs with some degree of independence or autonomy, and in doing so, employs a precise [knowledge representation](../glossary.md#knowledge-representation) of the user's goals or desires.

## Agents are Not Procedural Code

Here are some characteristics differentiating agents from standard
procedural code:

1.  **Autonomy**: Agents operate without direct human intervention, making decisions and taking actions based on their internal state and perception of the environment. Unlike procedural code, which executes a predetermined sequence of instructions, and can follow precise rules, agents can decide when and how to act.
2.  **Reactivity and Adaptability**: Agents can perceive their environment and respond to changes in a timely fashion, adjusting their behavior accordingly. Procedural code follows a fixed execution path regardless of environmental changes unless explicitly programmed to handle specific scenarios.
3.  **Goal-Orientation**: Agents act in pursuit of goals rather than simply executing instructions. They can prioritize actions, resolve conflicts between competing objectives, and find alternative paths to achieve their goals when faced with obstacles. Procedural code lacks this inherent purpose-driven behavior and instead follows explicit instructions without considering overarching objectives.
