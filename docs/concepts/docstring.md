# Python Docstring with @tool Annotation

A docstring in Python is a string literal that appears as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. It is used to document the purpose, behavior, parameters, and return values of the code object. Python docstrings are enclosed by triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`) and can span multiple lines.

When working with AI agents (particularly in frameworks like LangChain or SmoLAgents), the `@tool` annotation in a docstring is a special decorator or marker that designates a function as being callable by an agent. This process typically works as follows:

1. **Function Definition**: Create a Python function with clearly defined inputs and outputs.

2. **Docstring Documentation**: Write a comprehensive docstring that describes:
   - What the function does
   - The parameters it accepts
   - The return value and type
   - Any exceptions it might raise

3. **@tool Annotation**: Include the `@tool` marker within the docstring or as a decorator above the function definition.

4. **Registration**: The function is automatically registered in the agent's available toolset.

5. **Discovery and Usage**: When the agent needs to perform a task related to the function's capability, it can discover and call this function based on the description in the docstring.

Example:
```python
def search_database(query: str) -> list:
    """
    @tool
    Search the database for information matching the query string.
    
    Args:
        query: The search term to look for in the database
        
    Returns:
        A list of matching records from the database
    """
    # Implementation details
    results = db.execute_search(query)
    return results
```

This approach allows agents to understand not just what functions are available, but when and how to use them appropriately based on their documented purpose and parameters.
