# Getting Started

This section describes the steps you need to take to build and test your own intelligent agents on your own local computer.  The
ideal configuration is to have a local GPU with at least 12GB of RAM on the GPU.  Although you can still run agents on a local computer without a GPU, the response times might be so slow that you will become frustrated.  My local GPU is a NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti which returns 52 tokens per second.

You can test the tokens per second on your local computer using our lab on the [Deep Learning Course](https://dmccreary.github.io/deep-learning-course/labs/calculating-tokens-per-second/).

If you are not an expert on setting up Python, then setting up your local system can be VERY frustrating.
