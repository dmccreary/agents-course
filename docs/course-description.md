# Building Intelligent Software Agents with LLMs and Knowledge Graphs - Course Description

## Course Description

This 12-week course introduces students to the design, development, and deployment of intelligent software agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge representation systems. Students will learn to build autonomous computational entities that perform tasks with independence while effectively representing user goals and domain knowledge.

Through hands-on projects and practical exercises, students will explore the spectrum of agent capabilitiesâ€”from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated code-generating agents that can write and execute Python. The course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical implementation, with special focus on the emerging SmolAgents framework, local LLM deployment with Ollama, and effective knowledge representation techniques.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Implement various levels of LLM agent control (from basic decision-making to code generation)
- Deploy and run local LLMs using Ollama and similar frameworks
- Design effective tool catalogs with well-documented functions for agent use
- Create agents that combine public knowledge (from LLMs) with private knowledge sources
- Implement the ReAct framework to interleave reasoning and action in agent systems
- Develop autonomous agents that can understand, generate, and execute Python code
- Evaluate agent performance through structured peer review processes

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate Python programming skills
- Basic understanding of data types and structures
- Familiarity with GitHub or similar version control systems (helpful but not required)
- Experience with IDEs such as Visual Studio (helpful but not required)

## Note to Prospective Students

This course operates at the intersection of artificial intelligence, software engineering, and knowledge representation. While we provide substantial guidance, students should be prepared for a highly experimental learning environment, as agent technologies are rapidly evolving. Creative problem-solving and adaptation to emerging frameworks will be essential for success in this course.
